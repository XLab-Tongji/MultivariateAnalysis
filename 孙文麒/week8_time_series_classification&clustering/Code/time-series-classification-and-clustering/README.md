Time Series Classification and Clustering
=========================================

The work of [Dr. Eamonn Keogh at University of California Riverside](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/) has shown that a good way to classify time series is with a k-NN algorithm using a dynamic time warping similarity measure. 

This repo is meant to implement this time series classification method in Python.  The same techniques are also extended to clustering time series.

I have also written a [tutorial on this subject](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/alexminnaar/time-series-classification-and-clustering/blob/master/Time%20Series%20Classification%20and%20Clustering.ipynb).
